# High Level Context
## context
This file (src/index.ts) appears to be the main entry point for an Ollama client library, likely for interacting with a language model API. Key features include:

1. Extending a browser-compatible Ollama class with additional Node.js-specific functionality.
2. Implementing image encoding for handling various input formats (Uint8Array, Buffer, filepath, or base64 string).
3. Parsing and processing modelfiles, including resolving paths and creating file blobs.
4. Implementing a 'create' method for initializing models, supporting both streaming and non-streaming responses.
5. Providing utility functions for file operations, path resolution, and SHA256 hashing.
6. Exporting a default Ollama instance and all types from the interfaces file for easy import by consumers of the library.

The code combines browser and Node.js environments, handling file system operations, cryptographic functions, and API interactions, suggesting it's designed to work in various JavaScript environments.

# Ollama src/index.ts
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, Ollama is a class that extends OllamaBrowser. It provides functionality for working with Ollama, which is an open-source project for running large language models locally.

Key features of the Ollama class include:

1. Image encoding: The `encodeImage` method converts images to base64 format.

2. Modelfile parsing: The `parseModelfile` method processes modelfiles, replacing certain commands with blob hashes.

3. File operations: Methods like `resolvePath`, `fileExists`, and `createBlob` handle file-related tasks.

4. Model creation: The `create` method allows for creating models using either a path to a modelfile or modelfile content directly.

This class enhances the base OllamaBrowser functionality by adding custom logic for handling modelfiles, file operations, and model creation specific to the Ollama project. It's designed to work with the Ollama API and local file system to manage and create language models.
